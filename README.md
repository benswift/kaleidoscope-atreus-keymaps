# Atreus keymaps

These are my keymap files for the [Keyboardio
Atreus](https://shop.keyboard.io/collections/keyboardio-atreus/products/keyboardio-atreus).
They're pretty much the same as the first two layers from the "default"
keymap. The main changes are:

- layer 1: moved some of the parens around so that all open/close pairs are next to one another
- layer 1: put the numpad "+-*/" keys on the right-most column

There are a couple of other symbols I've moved around, but that's about it.

A couple of other notes:

- layer 0 is actually just the default keymap, but I've included it here in case
  it changes in future (since I like it like this)

- I *very rarely* (well, never actually) use layer 2+, so I've left those
  unchanged (the json files aren't even in this repo)

## Installation
